###BLOB TRACKER###
- ckeck collision between current blobs and list of active blobs
-- if blob from active blobs is not colliding with any current blob remove from active blobs list
-- if blob from current blobs is not colliding with any active blobs:
--- add to active blobs list with new ID
--- flag blob for polling
-- if blob from active blobs is colliding replace active blob with current blob
-- if current blob is colliding with more than one active blob:
--- players must be convoluted
--- assign current blobs atributes to all active blobs it's colliding with
--- flag all active blobs for polling
